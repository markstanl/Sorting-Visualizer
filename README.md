# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer 
This is a simple sorting algorithm visualizer that I made using Python and Pygame.
The pygame visualizer was made by following the tutorial by Tech With Tim on YouTube,
while the sorting algorithms were all implemented by me.
The following sorting algorithms are implemented:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Bogo Sort
